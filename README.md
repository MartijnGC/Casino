#Rules
The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21 points. 
If you get 21 points exactly you have a "Blackjack". 
All the cards have different value: 
- Ace : 11
- Two - Ten: The value of the card
- Jack, Queen and King: 10

At the beginning of the game you and the dealer get two cards each. 
The dealer has one card facing upwards and one facing downwards, so you only know the value of one of the cards of the dealer.
After the initial deal of the dealer you can choose if you want to "stay", "hit" or "double".
If for example you have a Queen and a 3 your total amount is 13, you can choose to take a hit (get another card).
 Or you choose to stand, keep 13. If you choose to double you double your bet and get one card, after this it is the turn of the dealer.
 Keep in mind that you want to get as close as possible to 21, or 21 but dont go over 21 because you will bust.

If you choose to take a stand it is the dealers turn, the dealer reveals his downwards card.
The dealer also tries to get as close as 21 as possible, if the dealer has a value equal or higher than you the dealer wins. 
If the dealer stands with a value lower than you or busts you win! 

When you get two cards with the same value you can choose to split these cards, this means that you play with multiple sets. 
For example when you get two sevens and you split you place the bet on both of the cards and get a second card on both of the sevens.
Then you can choose to hit,stand or double on the splitted cards and play on like it is a normal game.


Good luck and have fun!
